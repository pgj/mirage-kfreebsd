Mirage kFreeBSD Backend
=======================

This tiny project is about putting [Mirage](http://openmirage.org/) to
the FreeBSD kernel space for evaluation.  Contents of this repository
currently is as follows.


Warning
-------

*Please do note that this is a work-in-progress effort, which will work
only on the `amd64` architecture with a recent FreeBSD -CURRENT.  In
addition, some of the original features may not be yet implemented fully
at all.*


Prerequisites
-------------

In order to be able to build the sources, one has to install the OCaml
compiler from the Ports Collection.  (It has been tested with version
3.12.1 so far.)

    # cd /usr/ports/lang/ocaml
    # make install clean

It is also required to install the findlib utility.

    # cd /usr/ports/devel/ocaml-findlib
    # make install clean


Installing the Customized Standard Library
------------------------------------------

There is a customized standard library (which sources were ripped of the
3.12.1 OCaml distribution) to be built before one could work with the
sources.  It is in the following directory.

    packages/mirage-stdlib

It contains a standalone version of the modified sources that could be
compiled using BSD make.  It is possible to specify the place of the
used OCaml toolchain by the `PREFIX` variable.  By default, that is
`/usr/local`.

    # make install clean

This command will install the `mirage-stdlib` package that all the
others rely on.


Installing the Rest of the Packages
-----------------------------------

The other OCaml packages available are as follows.

    packages/cstruct
    packages/lwt
    packages/mirage-platform

All of them will be needed to build Mirage's OS module, which is then
required to build a FreeBSD kernel module. Packages `cstruct` and `lwt`
are stripped and adapted versions of the corresponding packages, while
`mirage-platform` implements the internals of the `OS` module.

Each of them can be installed from its directory with a single command
(as root):

    # make install clean


Creating and Loading An Application as Kernel Module
----------------------------------------------------

There is also a sample test application added in the following
directory.

    packages/mirage-test

It does not require to be installed, it is enough to build it (as root).

    # make

This should generate a kernel module under the name `mirage.ko`, which
then could be loaded into the running kernel.

**Warning: It is not guaranteed that the module will behave as expected.
Loading the module may result in a crash and, as a side effect, in data
loss.  Do not try this on a production machine ever.  You have been
warned!**

Note that since the kernel module is not installed to the default module
path, one must specify it by the name of the file.

    # kldload ./mirage.ko

Upon the successful loading, some sysctl(3) variables should be created
under the MIB `kern.mirage`.

    kern.mirage.debug

Set the verbosity of debug information provided by the module.  It is
`3` (the highest) by default -- set to `0` if no information is needed.

    kern.mirage.rtparams

Set parameters for the run-time system.  It is a string value that may take
exactly the same options as the `OCAMLRUNPARAM` environment variable in the
[Caml documentation](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml-4.00/manual024.html#toc97).

    kern.mirage.run

Start the code inside the kernel module.  Writing any value to this
variable will trigger the initialization routine and launches the
execution of the embedded OCaml program.  Note that a program may be
restarted many times, however this is not recommended -- reload the
module first instead.

    # sysctl kern.mirage.run=1
